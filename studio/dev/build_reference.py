"""Build the stored Daytona Milton Keynes reference centerline (studio/mk_centerline.json).

The reference is the FALLBACK gap-fill source (used only where no measured lap covers a
section). The stored polyline is the BEST CLEAN LAP loop of a real session, resampled and
normalized to the unit square — i.e. the actual driven racing line, which is exactly the
shape the fill needs (gap mouths are pinned by a similarity transform, so only the corner
SHAPE matters). `studio/reference.py` aligns it to any session's best-lap loop at load
(cyclic arc-length correspondence + similarity transform, reflection allowed).

Regenerate from a session: python -m studio.dev.build_reference SESSION.MP4 [more chapters]
Validate only (no write):  python -m studio.dev.build_reference --validate SESSION.MP4 [...]
Legacy hand-trace build:   python -m studio.dev.build_reference --hand-trace

Each build also prints the fit RMS + footprint coverage against the source session (and
`--validate` against any other session) — regenerate from one session and `--validate`
against another for an honest cross-session check.

History: the original polyline was digitized BY EYE from a thumbnail of the track image
`/Users/daniil/Desktop/Tracks/MK/gmaps_pict.png` (no embedded geo-coordinates). That trace
turned out to be a poor rendition of the real layout — even a globally-correct similarity
fit (the cyclic-correspondence fit in reference.py) could only reach RMS ≈ 21 m / 42 %
footprint coverage against real sessions — so the shipped JSON was rebuilt from measured
GPS. The waypoints are kept below (`_WAYPOINTS`, `--hand-trace`) for provenance only.
