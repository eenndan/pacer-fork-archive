"""Driving channels (F5): brake events, coasting spans, per-corner grip utilization.

PACER-FREE BY CONTRACT (numpy only). Fed by Session's per-lap arrays (the kart-frame g
series from gmeter.py + the lap's odometer / elapsed / speed) — Session owns the
caching/invalidations and the views consume the results through it, so neither this module
nor the views ever import the compiled `pacer` bindings (the studio architecture rule).

WHAT THIS DERIVES, and from WHICH validated signal
--------------------------------------------------
The only new physics here is reading the ALREADY-VALIDATED vehicle-frame g (studio/gmeter.py:
ACCL/GRAV/CORI -> kart frame, GPS-cross-checked at load) and labelling three things on it:

  * BRAKE EVENTS — the kart is decelerating hard. gmeter's sign convention is
    `long_g > 0` = accelerating, `long_g < 0` = braking, so a brake event is a contiguous
    run of `long_g < -theta_b` (a real, sustained decel — not throttle-lift coast). Onset =
    where it first crosses below `-theta_b`; the run is held open with HYSTERESIS until the
    decel recovers above `-theta_b * RELEASE_RATIO` (a Schmitt trigger so brake-pressure
    ripple right at the threshold doesn't shatter one zone into many). Each event records its
    onset (lap odometer + elapsed time), peak decel (g, a positive magnitude), and duration.

  * COASTING SPANS — neither braking nor accelerating: |long_g| < theta_c AND |lat_g| <
    theta_lat (not loaded up in a corner either) AND only a mild speed change across the span
    (guards against a long, gentle, steady-throttle pull reading as "coast"). This is the
    Circuit Tools "coasting" maths channel, but off the REAL IMU instead of a speed
    derivative.

  * PER-CORNER GRIP UTILIZATION — inside each corner window (from the F2 corner model), how
    much of the available grip the driver used: median(|g|) / envelope_max, where |g| is the
    friction-circle magnitude hypot(lat, long) and envelope_max is the lap's own peak |g|
    (its measured traction limit — the same per-lap max-G envelope the g-meter dial draws).
    A fraction in (0, 1]; higher in the hard corners. Median (not mean) so a one-sample IMU
    spike at turn-in can't inflate it, and it reflects the sustained load through the corner.

THRESHOLDS ARE DERIVED FROM THE SESSION'S OWN G DISTRIBUTION (no magic constants)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Like the corner model derived its curvature threshold from the track's own |kappa|
distribution, the brake/coast thresholds come from THIS recording's measured longitudinal-g
distribution, so they self-scale to the kart, the grip level, and the IMU's noise floor:

  theta_b (brake decel threshold) = the MEDIAN of the BRAKING-ONLY decel distribution: "a real
    brake event is at least the typical brake application." Real kart braking is HARD and
    FREQUENT — the long-g signal is NOT a near-zero spike with a thin tail. MEASURED on the two
    D24 validation recordings over the moving samples (GX010060 / GX010062):
      - signed long_g: p50 +0.06 g (a slight accel bias), p25 -0.36 g, p10 -0.72 g, p1 -1.16 g;
        51% of moving samples are accelerating (>0.05 g), 40% are BRAKING (decel >0.05 g).
      - BRAKING-only decel: p10 0.12 g, p25 0.25 g, p50 ~0.46 g, p75 ~0.71 g, p90 ~0.95 g,
        max ~1.5 g.
    So theta_b = median(braking decel) lands at 0.463 g (0060) / 0.452 g (0062) — within 2.4%
    across recordings, because the median of the BRAKING side is DUTY-CYCLE INDEPENDENT (a
    percentile of ALL moving samples shifts with how much of the lap is braking; the
    braking-only median does not). At 0.46 g it marks the DECISIVE braking zones (~10 onsets
    per lap on the ~12-corner validation track), comfortably above any throttle-lift coast and
    below the deepest threshold-braking. Floored at THETA_B_FLOOR so a session with almost no
    braking cannot drive it into the noise. VALIDATED: against the independent GPS
    speed-derivative brake-onset method, the matched onsets correlate r≈1.00 in track position
    with a ~5-6 m median offset, and there are ZERO brake onsets on the full-throttle straight.

  theta_c (coast |long_g| band) / theta_lat (coast |lat_g| band): the level BELOW which the
    kart is neither braking/accelerating nor loaded in a corner. Taken as a low percentile
    (COAST_PERCENTILE) of |long_g| / |lat_g| over the moving samples, then floored. MEASURED:
    |long_g| p40 ~0.22 g, |lat_g| p40 ~0.35 g on the validation recordings — and coasting
    requires BOTH bands at once (an AND), so a sample only counts as coasting when its
    longitudinal AND lateral g are both in their low-percentile band AND the speed is barely
    changing. On the real laps this lands 1-6 short coasting spans per lap (0.3-2.9 s total) in
    the slow/transition zones, not on the hard corners or the straights.

All of these are reported by `derive_thresholds(...).describe()` (printed once at load next to
the g cross-check) so the numbers that set the thresholds on THIS session are always visible.

SMOOTHING
---------
The g series is already low-passed in gmeter (0.15 s boxcar). We add a short additional
SMOOTH_S boxcar before thresholding so a single high-frequency IMU sample can't open/close a
brake event; the corner-grip median is robust without it.
