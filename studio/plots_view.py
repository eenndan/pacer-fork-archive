"""PlotsView: speed (top) and lap-vs-best delta (bottom) on ONE shared, x-linked x-axis.

Shows the laps selected in the lap table. A vertical cursor on both plots follows the
video position whenever the currently-playing lap is among those displayed.

Both plots share a single x-axis driven by the dist/time toggle and kept x-linked, so the same
media moment maps to the same x on both → the two cursors ALWAYS line up vertically (and pan/zoom
on one follows the other). In distance mode x = normalized-distance × best-lap distance (metres,
the axis `session.delta` draws the curves on); in time mode x = time-into-lap (seconds).

The cursor is also a SCRUBBER: it is draggable on both plots, and dragging it seeks the video
within the current lap. The delta plot additionally shows a HOVER DOT that rides the delta curve
under the mouse with its Δ value — independent of the playback cursor, to inspect any point.

This view stays pacer-free — it only emits the raw plot-x and which axis/plot a scrub came from
(`scrubStarted` / `scrubMoved(x, mode)` / `scrubEnded`); app.py owns session + video and does all
conversion, throttled seeking, pause/resume and re-sync. The always-on Δ/speed readout box lives
in app.py too (values from session); the hover dot reads only the curve already drawn here.
