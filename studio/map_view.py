"""MapView: the track trace with draggable start/sector timing lines + a video marker.

Timing lines are drawn in LOCAL meters (same space as the trace). Each line is two
draggable pyqtgraph TargetItem handles joined by a segment; handles are placed FREELY
(no snap to trace) and stay exactly where the user drops them — releasing a handle
re-segments the laps once. The red marker tracks the video position and, when dragged,
seeks the video to the nearest telemetry sample.
