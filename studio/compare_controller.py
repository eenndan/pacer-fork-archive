"""CompareController: the dual-lap compare-mode behavioural cluster, extracted from StudioWindow.

Compare mode shows two equal side-by-side video panes (the PRIMARY/left pane keeps driving ALL
telemetry exactly as in single-video mode; the SECONDARY/right pane is video-only) playing
"time into lap" — both roll from S/F at 1×, the faster pulls ahead, each shown as a per-pane
"Δ vs other" badge. This object OWNS the compare state (the on/off flag + the pinned (A,B) lap ids)
and the enter/exit-compare orchestration + the per-tick compare upkeep (`tick`: pane times, badges,
secondary g, the (t_a,t_b) early-out incl. the scrub-bypass, and the F4 map GHOST — lap B's kart
drawn on the track map at the secondary pane's own time, removed on exit).

It is a plain control-layer collaborator: it talks to Session's public API and the view widgets it
is handed, never to `pacer` directly (the views-stay-pacer-free boundary). It is Qt-free itself —
StudioWindow forwards the compare/repoint signals + the per-tick compare branch into it, injecting
its collaborators + the small auto-follow / default-selection hooks it needs (entering/leaving
compare suspends StudioWindow's auto-follow re-point and restores the table-driven selection).

Behaviour is byte-identical to the pre-extraction StudioWindow methods (`_on_compare_toggled`,
`_enter_compare`, `_exit_compare`, `_on_pane_repoint`, `_compare_tick`, `_set_pane_badge`,
`_reset_pair_to_start`, `_seek_pane_to_lap_start`, `_lap_caption`, `_lap_choice_labels`); this is a
move + dependency-injection, not a redesign.
