"""GMeterOverlay: a subtle "G meter" dial painted OVER the video (felt-force convention).

A frameless, translucent, always-on-top top-level window pinned to the QVideoWidget's TOP-RIGHT
corner and sized as a fraction of the video, drawn with a faint backdrop so it sits subtly over
footage. It shows the inertial reaction the DRIVER'S BODY feels (not the raw acceleration
vector), a translucent red max-G envelope of the grip used this lap, and the peak g reached in
each cardinal direction.

Why a top-level window and not a plain child widget: on macOS a QVideoWidget renders through a
NATIVE surface (its own QWindow) that the window-server composites independently of Qt's z-order
for ordinary ("alien", non-native) child widgets. A child overlay therefore lands in the parent's
backing store and is painted OVER by the native video layer — invisible on screen even though it
exists in the widget tree. Giving the overlay its own native top-level window makes the
window-server composite it as a separate layer ABOVE the video surface, so it shows over live
footage. The VideoView keeps it pinned to the video's corner on move/resize/show.

THE FELT-FORCE CONVENTION (the pointer = what the driver's body feels, not the accel vector)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`session.g_at_time` reports the kart-frame ACCELERATION in g (validated in studio/gmeter.py):
  +lateral      = turning LEFT,     -lateral      = turning RIGHT
  +longitudinal = ACCELERATING,     -longitudinal = BRAKING
The body feels the inertial REACTION — the opposite of the acceleration. We map that felt force
onto the dial so it reads like the g-meter in a car:
  * BRAKING (long<0)  -> pointer UP    (you're thrown forward / "up" on the meter)
  * ACCELERATING      -> pointer DOWN
  * turning RIGHT     -> pointer LEFT  (you're thrown to the left)
  * turning LEFT      -> pointer RIGHT
Screen mapping (screen +x = right, screen +y = down):
  dx =  +lateral * scale        (left-turn -> right; right-turn -> left)
  dy =  +longitudinal * scale   (braking long<0 -> up; accelerating long>0 -> down)
i.e. the pointer is the felt force −(accel) expressed in the dial's up=forward-thrown frame.

HELMET-SHAKE FILTERING (the GoPro is chin-mounted; the accel carries head/mount jitter)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The gross g is good (lateral cross-check r≈0.90) but a chin mount adds high-frequency shake on
top of the real vehicle g. So the DOT is driven by a short exponential moving average of the
felt-force g (smooth but still responsive to real braking/cornering), and the ENVELOPE / peak-g
NUMBERS use that filtered signal PLUS a high-percentile (robust) peak so a single shake spike
can't blow the envelope or the cardinal numbers out to a spurious huge value.

MAX-G ENVELOPE (the red blob) + cardinal peaks
----------------------------------------------
Filtered felt-force points are accumulated and their swept area is filled in translucent red
(a convex hull of the points) — the grip envelope used in the current scope. The four cardinal
numbers are the robust peak felt-g reached forward/back/left/right. Scope defaults to the
CURRENT LAP and resets at the lap boundary (`set_lap` drives this); change `_RESET_ON_LAP` or
call `reset_envelope()` for other scopes.

This widget is `pacer`-free: it knows nothing about the telemetry source. The app feeds it
`set_g((lateral_g, longitudinal_g, total_g))` and `set_lap(lap_id)` at the ~30 Hz tick. The
convention flip + filtering are DISPLAY concerns and live here; the validated g values in
`session`/`gmeter.py` are untouched.
