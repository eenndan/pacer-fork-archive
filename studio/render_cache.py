"""LapRenderCache — the per-lap MAP-RENDERING cache cluster, extracted from Session.

What lives here (and ONLY here): the gap-aware draw segments the map renders for a lap
(`lap_trace_segments` — measured GPS runs + reconstructed fills, via studio/gapfill.py)
and the georeferenced reference-centerline fallback donor that reconstruction can borrow
from (via studio/reference.py). Nothing in this module alters any analysis quantity (lap
times, distances, deltas) — it only decides what the map DRAWS across GPS dropouts.

PACER-FREE by design (PLAN.md: only ingest/load/session/tracks may import pacer): every
input arrives as a plain numpy array or a Session-bound callable over Session's own cached
per-lap arrays, so this module never touches the bound core.

Cache lifetime — the perf invariant (see Session.set_timing_lines): the draw segments are
computed once per lap on FIRST DRAW, never per frame, and become stale on re-segmentation
(lap ids, windows and donor traces all change when a timing line moves), so Session calls
`invalidate()` from set_timing_lines. The reference centerline is intentionally NOT
dropped there — same behaviour as before the extraction: it's only the last-resort fill
donor (the cross-lap borrow dominates), and the georeferenced track shape is good enough
for a dimmed dashed fill regardless of which lap it was fit against.
