"""PlayerPane: one self-contained single-lap video player (the reusable unit of the player).

Extracted verbatim from the original VideoView so it can be composed: a PlayerPane owns ONE
QMediaPlayer + QVideoWidget + QAudioOutput plus an attached g-meter overlay, and presents a
(possibly chaptered) recording as ONE continuous video on a GLOBAL session clock. VideoView is
now a thin shell that wraps exactly one PlayerPane and adds the transport row + slider; Phase B
will compose two panes side by side. The single-lap behaviour is byte-for-byte the legacy one.

A recording can be a single file OR a chaptered multi-file recording (a long GoPro session
split at a size limit into chapters that are contiguous in time). QMediaPlayer plays exactly
ONE source, so to present a multi-chapter recording as one continuous video this pane keeps
the ordered chapter list + cumulative offsets (a `chapters.ChapterMap`) and:

  * The emitted position is in GLOBAL session time (0..sum-of-durations), so the telemetry sync
    (cursor, map marker, plots, readout) sees one continuous clock.
  * `seek(global_t)` maps the global time to (chapter i, local_t); if chapter i isn't the
    current source it SWITCHES the source to chapter i, then seeks to local_t.
  * On `EndOfMedia` for chapter i it auto-loads chapter i+1 and keeps playing from 0, so
    playback flows ACROSS chapters with no user action (a brief reopen hitch at the seam is
    expected — QMediaPlayer reopens the file).
  * `positionChanged` (a LOCAL media position) is converted to global (+offset of the current
    chapter) before being emitted.

For a single-file recording the ChapterMap has one entry at offset 0, so global == local and
behaviour is exactly the legacy single-source path.

THE G-METER OVERLAY (load-bearing macOS behaviour — preserved exactly)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The classic friction-circle g-meter is drawn ON the video as a frameless translucent TOP-LEVEL
window (not a plain child) so the window-server composites it ABOVE the QVideoWidget's native
video surface — a child widget is painted behind that surface on macOS and never shows on
screen. The pane pins it to the video's TOP-RIGHT corner in GLOBAL screen coords, sized as a
fraction of the video, and keeps it there as the video moves/resizes. Keeping it pinned needs
SEVEN hooks, all preserved here: installEventFilter on the video widget (Move/Resize), the
pane's own moveEvent / resizeEvent / showEvent / hideEvent / closeEvent, and the per-tick
re-pin inside set_g (a top-level window does NOT follow the parent when the WHOLE app window is
dragged, so it must be re-pinned from the ~30 Hz tick). Driven by the app via set_g / set_lap.
