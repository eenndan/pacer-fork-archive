C++ analysis (segmentation, distances, lap timing, delta resample) comes from `pacer`;
the load pipeline is in studio/load.py, map-render caching in studio/render_cache.py

        `lap_sector_splits` measures the splits: project each sector line's midpoint onto this
        lap's trace and take the nearest point's cum_distance, then return them ASCENDING. So the
        boundary guide lines on the charts (F2) land exactly where the split times are measured.

        Two robustness guards live here (the single source of every consumer's boundaries):
          * WINDOWED projection — a plain global argmin over the whole lap snaps a line to its
            globally-nearest trace point, which on an out-and-back / hairpin (the line's midpoint
            sits near two passes) or two lines placed close together can pick the WRONG pass and
            put the boundary at a bogus odometer. So each line is first projected globally to find
            its lap fraction, then RE-projected within a window around that fraction, breaking
            wrong-pass ties toward the expected location while leaving a normal, well-separated
            line on a single-pass section byte-identical to the old global argmin.
          * DEDUPE — after sorting, boundaries within `_SECTOR_DEDUPE_FRAC` of the previous one
            are dropped, so a duplicate / mis-snapped line can never yield a zero-length (or, once
            the sort masks it, out-of-order) split. Returning fewer boundaries than lines is fine:
            lap_sector_splits derives its split count from THIS list, and the table simply shows a
            blank in any trailing S-column a deduped lap no longer fills (its highlight/best-split
