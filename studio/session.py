"""Session: load GoPro/GPMF telemetry into a `pacer.Laps` and expose UI-friendly data.

All the C++ analysis (lap/sector segmentation, distances, lap-vs-best delta resampling,
timestamp interpolation) is reused via the bound `pacer` module. This file only adds the
thin glue the old ImGui app kept inline in laps-display.cpp: building plot series, the
delta computation, and writing dragged timing lines back to the core.

Coordinate note (verified against pacer/laps/laps.cpp): the track trace and the timing
lines both live in LOCAL meters (cs.local). `pick_random_start()`/`update()` must run
AFTER `set_coordinate_system()`.
