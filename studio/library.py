"""Session library: a local index of analyzed recordings (F8) with PB progression.

Every successful load UPSERTS the opened recording into one JSON index stored in the macOS
app-support dir, ``~/Library/Application Support/pacer/library.json``. Re-opening the SAME
recording updates its entry in place rather than appending a duplicate — the dialog then lists
every recording you've analyzed (date / track / best lap / theoretical best), re-opens any of
them, and draws a per-track PB-progression mini-chart (best lap vs date).

This module is PACER-FREE BY CONTRACT — like ``studio.sidecar`` it is pure path resolution,
schema validation and atomic JSON I/O, unit-testable with no telemetry file and no Qt. The
recording's analyzed values are extracted from the live ``Session`` by the caller
(``Session.library_entry()``) and handed in as a plain dict; this file never imports pacer.

Identity — the FINGERPRINT. One entry per *recording*, keyed by the recording's CHAPTER-INVARIANT
identity (e.g. ``"GX0062"`` — the GoPro prefix + 4-digit recording number, shared by every chapter
of one recording). WHY this key and not the file path or the per-chapter stem: the same recording
can be opened as a single chapter (GX010062.MP4) or as its full chaptered chain
(GX010062+GX020062+GX030062), and BOTH the path list AND the total media duration differ between
those two opens (a single chapter is ~1730 s; the full chain ~4655 s) — so neither can key the
identity without splitting one recording into two rows. The (prefix, recording number) pair is the
ONE thing identical across any chapter or chapter-set of a recording, so both opens map to ONE
entry. (The per-chapter index ``CC`` is deliberately NOT in the key — ``GX010062`` and
``GX020062`` are the same recording.) For a non-GoPro clip (e.g. the bundled ``hero6.mp4``) the
caller falls back to the bare stem, keyed on its own so it can never collide with a real recording.

Schema (version 1) — one JSON object::

    {"version": 1,
     "entries": [
       {"fingerprint": "GX0062",            # the chapter-invariant identity key (see above)
        "stem":        "GX010062",          # first-chapter stem, for display
        "track":       <registry track name or null>,
        "date":        "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,  # GPS9 wall-clock date (Session.session_date)
        "lap_count":   <int>,                # valid lap count
        "best":        <float seconds> | null,    # best lap time
        "theoretical": <float seconds> | null,    # Session.theoretical_best
        "paths":       ["/abs/GX010062.MP4", ...]}, # the chapter file path(s) as opened (absolute)
       ...]}

Defensive load (two tiers): FILE-level corruption (missing file, not JSON, not a dict, wrong
version, non-list ``entries``) → a fresh EMPTY index ``{"version": 1, "entries": []}`` — the
"self-heal to a safe default" philosophy of the sidecar's revert guard, so a garbage file never
crashes the library. But a single malformed ENTRY is NOT fatal: ``load`` keeps the valid entries
and drops only the bad rows (logging the count). Rejecting the whole index over one bad row would
discard every OTHER recording's history — and since ``save`` rewrites only the survivors, the next
upsert would PERSIST that loss permanently — so the all-or-nothing contract that suits a 2-line
sidecar is data-loss for a multi-recording index.

Float round-trip: json writes floats with ``repr`` (the shortest EXACT double string), so a
save→load round trip of ``best``/``theoretical`` is bit-identical.
