"""Session library: a local index of analyzed recordings (F8) with PB progression.

Every successful load upserts the opened recording into one JSON index in the macOS app-support
dir; the dialog lists every analyzed recording, re-opens any, and draws a per-track PB chart.
PACER-FREE: pure path resolution, schema validation and atomic JSON I/O (the analyzed values
arrive as a plain dict from ``Session.library_entry()``).

fingerprint = (GoPro prefix, recording number) so every chapter of a recording maps to one
entry — neither the path list nor the media duration is stable across a single-chapter vs a full
chaptered open of the SAME recording.

Schema (version 1) — one JSON object::

    {"version": 1,
     "entries": [
       {"fingerprint": "GX0062",            # the chapter-invariant identity key (see above)
        "stem":        "GX010062",          # first-chapter stem, for display
        "track":       <registry track name or null>,
        "date":        "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,  # GPS9 wall-clock date (Session.session_date)
        "lap_count":   <int>,                # valid lap count
        "best":        <float seconds> | null,    # best lap time
        "theoretical": <float seconds> | null,    # Session.theoretical_best
        "paths":       ["/abs/GX010062.MP4", ...]}, # the chapter file path(s) as opened (absolute)
       ...]}

Load self-heals: file-level corruption -> empty index; one bad entry -> dropped (count logged),
the rest kept (so the next ``save``, which rewrites only the survivors, doesn't lose all history).
