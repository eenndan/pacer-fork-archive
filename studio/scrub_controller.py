"""ScrubController: the plot-cursor scrub cluster (fine, lap-scoped scrub over speed/Δ charts;
the full-video slider is separate). In compare mode the drag is distance-locked and parks BOTH
panes on the same track position.

Coalesce contract: a drag move only stashes the latest target + a dirty flag; the seek(s) AND the
cursor/marker/readout refresh are coalesced to <=1 each per tick (`apply_tick`, from `_tick`) —
this keeps the tick cheap and breaks the drag<->positionChanged feedback loop. Pacer-free, Qt-free.
