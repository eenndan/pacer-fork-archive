"""Single-pass ingest equivalence (PR #40): `ingest.read_recording` == the pre-#40 two-pass reads.

PR #40 replaced the studio load path's TWO `chain_sources` builds (read_gpmf opened and
GPMF-parsed every chapter once for GPS, read_imu opened them all AGAIN for ACCL/GRAV/CORI) with
ONE shared chain that both passes run over (`read_recording`). The claim is byte-identical
output. Two pins:

1. SHARED-CHAIN EQUIVALENCE on real media: `read_recording([sample])` over the bundled GoPro
   sample clips must equal a hand-built replica of the pre-#40 behaviour — two FRESH
   `GPMFSource` opens of the same file, one drained for GPS exactly as `read_gpmf`'s inline pass
   did, the other read for IMU exactly as `read_imu` did — exactly, for every GPS field and
   every IMU stream. hero6.mp4 carries GPS5 + ACCL (no GRAV/CORI on that camera; their
   equivalence there is empty == empty); hero8.mp4 carries GPS + all three IMU streams.

2. IMU-AFTER-GPS-DRAIN INVARIANCE on a Python stub: the single-pass design relies on the IMU
   readers being independent of the GPS payload cursor (`_read_imu_over` runs AFTER
   `_read_gps_over` has seeked/walked the same source to its end). Drive ingest's internal GPS
   helper over a plain-Python `RawGPSSource` whose IMU readers honour that same contract, and
   assert the IMU reads after the drain equal the reads before it. (The trampoline covers the
   GPS `ReadSamples` virtual too — test_gps_source_bindings.py proves a fully-Python source
   feeds GPS through a C++ `SequentialGPSSource` — but this invariance pin only needs the stub
   driven through ingest's Python-side helpers.)
