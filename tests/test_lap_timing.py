"""Tests for the GPS9 true-clock time axis (studio.session._gps9_times).

The lap timer compares two start/finish-line crossing instants. The C++ core already
INTERPOLATES each crossing time along the chord (pacer::Split), so the accuracy of a lap time
is set by the per-sample TIME AXIS. The old `naive` axis spread each payload's media span over
i/n samples; the GoPro media clock for the GPS track runs ~0.1% fast, which systematically
compressed every lap. `_gps9_times` instead uses the GPS9 fix timestamps' true 10 Hz spacing,
re-anchored per contiguous run to the media (naive) clock — so the axis stays on the media clock
the video layer maps against, but inter-sample spacing is the real wall-clock spacing.

These tests run on synthetic samples (no telemetry file). Run: python tests/test_lap_timing.py
