"""Real-widget regression tests for the cross-recording compare + layout fixes (f7 phase B).

The PR-#80 tests drove a FAKE VideoView (a recorder that only captured the args to set_compare),
so they never exercised the real VideoView -> PlayerPane -> QMediaPlayer playback and missed three
real-GUI bugs:

  1. enter_cross's set_compare flips the compare TOGGLE button checked, which (signal still live)
     re-entered the app's on_toggled -> same-recording enter() -> set_compare with a pane B spec
     whose source is None, REBUILDING pane B on the PRIMARY recording's source. Pane B then played
     the wrong (original) footage. Fixed by syncing the toggle WITHOUT emitting (_sync_compare_btn).
  2. The compare panes came up unequal and the splitter handle wouldn't drag. Fixed with an
     entry-time 50/50 split from the splitter's real width + a draggable handle (width / no-collapse
     / opaque resize / per-cell size policy / a video-surface inset).
  3. The pane-B lap-start seek could be dropped by an async-load race on a freshly-created secondary
     (a leftover chapter-0 load satisfying the pending cross-chapter seek). Fixed by gating the
     deferred-seek apply on the genuinely-loaded source FILE (PlayerPane._source_is_chapter).

These tests use the REAL VideoView / PlayerPane with PACER_NO_MEDIA=1 (the production widget tree,
an inert media triplet) where a real decoder isn't needed, plus an OPT-IN real-media test on the
D24 footage when present (skipped otherwise) that proves pane B's actual QMediaPlayer source is the
reference file at the reference lap's S/F. Run: python tests/test_video_view_compare.py
