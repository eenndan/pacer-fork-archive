"""ONE synthetic bare-Session factory for the pure-Python studio tests.

Not a test (no CTest registration) — a helper module the test_*.py files import. The studio
tests drive REAL Session math (delta/odometer/scrub conversions, nearest-in-lap, lap_at_time)
on a Session built via __new__ with its private caches seeded directly — the seeding idiom
Session explicitly supports for tests. Each file used to hand-roll its own variant, and some
seeded the legacy 2-tuple (times, dists) `_dist_cache` form, which kept a test-only upgrade
shim alive in production. This module is now the single place that knows the cache shapes:
  * `_dist_cache[lap_id] = (times, dists, elapsed)` — the CURRENT 3-tuple form
    (elapsed = times - times[0], exactly what `Session._lap_time_dist_elapsed` memoizes);
  * `_valid_cache` / `_best_cache` — the `valid_lap_ids()` / `best_lap_id()` memo slots, so
    the REAL methods serve the seeded ids without a pacer `laps` object.
Anything pacer-backed beyond that (lap_window, lap_at_time, g_at_time, ...) stays a per-test
stub at the call site — only what a test genuinely needs is faked.
